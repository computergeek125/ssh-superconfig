Things to do:
 - Figure out YAML format

Features to add:
 - Read YAML file
 - regex matching
 - call specific ssh binary
 - All basic functionality from regular ssh config (possible passthrough)
 - Wildcard matching:
   - Acquire a list of recent/known hosts
   - Do partial string matching on hosts, and run either the first suggestion on a list or ask
